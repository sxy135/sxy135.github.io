                                        <p>I interviewed two stakeholders.The first one is an international graduate student who has suffered a lot of stress after she first comes to America. She might be the target user of the product or service we are going to design. The other one is the student’s mother who lives in China, she might use our design to get to know more about her daughter’s mental health condition.</p>
                                        <p>Findings From the Interview:</p>
                                        <p>
                                       1.People do not know clearly about the existing mental health counseling services provided by the counseling center and the health center.<br>
                                       2.Students do not know where to go when they are looking for professional help.<br>
                                       3.Students are not likely to seek professional help at the early stage, which might cause the situation to become even worse later.<br>
                                       4.Some factors like the culture background, language, cost, the complicated procedure and the long waiting time prevent students from looking for professional help. <br>
                                       5.Parents do not know their children’s mental health condition.<br>
                                        </p>
                                        <br>

                                        <p>After gathering all the user interview information in our group, we created personas for our project. They represent the two sets of user types we believe will be our primary target audience. They use the <a href="http://gendermag.org/">GenderMag</a> personas ‘Abby’ and ‘Pat’ respectively as their base.</p>

                                        <p>After the user research, our group conducted an affinity diagramming to help us analyze the core problems and design points of the project. By labelling and grouping the key points, we find some categories of problems which we should focus on in the next step.</p>

                                        <p>Based on the affinity diagramming results,we brainstormed together to get some possible solutions to the four kinds of questions that we disscussed above.
                                        Then we did affinity diagramming once again on these solutions to group them together and find some “hot ideas“. The image on the right shows our "hot ideas" from brainstorming.</p>

                                        <p>After that, I sketched 20 new ideas to solve the problems based on our brainstorm results. The new ideas used technologies like AR, wearable devices, machine learning and so on.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Low Fidelity Prototyping</h3><br>
                                        <p>Our group picked up two ideass to develop low fidelity prototypes after discussing and comparing all our 80 sketches. We chose those two ideas because they are both fairly effective solutions to the design problems we discussed before. Also, we wanted to try both of the two directions, one is professional while the other one is gamify. So we chose two quite different solutions.</p>
                                        <p>The first one is my idea of using AR drift bottle games to telling or listening stories and also encourage students with mental health problems to go outside. The second one is using crowdsourcing to provide off-campus online mental health counselling services for students by pairing them with doctors.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/counselink/prototype1.jpg" width="100%" ></div>
                                        <p>I created low fidelity prototype for the VR drift bottle idea with another team member. We made paper prototypes for fifteen main interfaces of the AR bottle app, including three AR screens made of transparent papers. We also created a toolkit of the possible messages, labels or pop-ups in the process of interacting with our app. We used a framework of phone to indicate the current interface on the screen. </p>
                                        <p>For the VR screen, we used a piece of transparent paper with bottle images on it attatched to the iPhone frame to create the view of AR. Users can use this AR view to pick up bottles around them to listen to others’ stories and help them solve mental problems, and they can also throw bottles to tell their stories.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/counselink/prototype2.jpg" width="100%" ></div>
                                        <p>The red bottles on the VR screen of this App represents more urgent situation, only professional helpers can pick up it. While blue bottles means showing to everyone. You can choose the color of your bottle and the radius it will flow while creating it.</p>
                                        <p>The image below shows the user flow of this prototype.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/counselink/bottleflow.png" width="100%" ></div>
                                        <p>The photo below is the user flow of the other prototype made by our team members. This solution aims at pairing studnets with mental health counselors. This paper prototype consists of 15 screens from the product itself. They used colored sticky notes to represent the user interface elements.</p>

                                        <p>We did two heuristic evaluations on our "bottle" prototype with two chosen evaluators. There was one “computer” present during the testing and one “observer”. Since we were doing evaluations we answered any questions that the evaluator came up with. Both evaluators were presented with our low-fi prototype and helped along the way by our “computer”.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/counselink/test.jpg" width="100%" ></div>
                                        <p>During our evaluation many usability flaws came to light. There were some critical user interaction oversights in our prototype, like the ability to close message popups that came to light immediately in our evaluations.</p>
                                        <p>One issue that both evaluators pointed out that was <strong>a lack of helpful messages, tips or basic signifiers</strong> in our design. In of our tests were even forced to make a confirmation dialog on the fly for deleted a message. </p>
                                        <p>Both evaluators pointed out <strong>a classification issue of the bottles</strong>. Our design lacked any signifier showing bottles that belonged to the user themselves.</p>
                                        <p>They also pointed out that our design idea may “<strong>lacks proper encouragement to go out and interact with the world for our users<strong>”. And they suggested that maybe the map screen could be our default home screen instead of the AR camera screen. </p>
                                        <p>When we asked both our evaluators about the <strong>gamifying aspect of it we got the feedback that the gamification aspect of it can easily be increased by adding some sort of reward system<strong>. Both our testers came up with similar inputs to the idea.</p>
                                        <br><br>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Final Design Choice</h3><br>
                                        <p>The heuristic evaluations and testing came up with great insights regarding both prototypes. Most of the people who participated in our testing were interested the concept of our AR bottle prototype (MoodBottle). Instead of providing conventional mental health counseling services, MoodBottle was acclaimed as a more entertaining and interactive way to address this kind of issue. At the same time, the evaluators for the other prototype (Shout-Out) also refer the idea as a very efficient and feasible approach to create an online network for both patients and counselors.</p>
                                        <p>After that, we had an informal feedback session for both prototypes. The effectiveness of MoodBottle came into question as an effective design solution to solve the problem. Our target users might not be willing to use MoodBottle since this kind of gaming activity did not fit the user’s possible emotional status. Also, an AR game like this will require the involvement of certain amount of user population, which cannot be achieved in a short period of time. While the idea of AR game might be a creative design exercise, we have to pay attention to our <strong>users' real needs</strong>.</p>

                                        <p>Then we refined the original idea, modified the usability flaws shown in heuristic evaluation and added some new feaatures such as smart decision tree to the App. We confirmed its function architecture for future design.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/counselink/function.jpg" width="100%" ></div>
                                        <p>The main purpose of CounseLink is to get a patient user streamlined counseling help. With a single page registration, the patient user can easily request a counseling session. User can describe their condition, specifying the issue they have, and set preferences for the desired counselor. After being paired to a counselor, user can start online chatting instantly, and rate the counselor after the session is over.</p>
                                        <p>For counselors, they will receive counseling request from the patient users. When they enter the app, they will see the information which patients entered. Counselors will decide whether they will accept the request or not based on those information. If they accept it, the session will start immediately. Both sides can end the session at any time.</p>

                                        <p>Finally we built our high fidelity prototype and the user flow of our desgin. We decided to name it "CounseLink" since its main function is to connect students with the counselors. The pictures below shows the design decisions, rationales and the iteration process of our visual design.</p>

                                        <p>After designing the high fidelity prototype, we built the user flow for our app.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/counselink/finalflow.png" width="100%" ></div><br><br>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Limitations and Future Work</h3><br>
                                        <p>Below are the limitations of our present design, these limitations are also the problems we need to solve in future work.</p>
                                        <p>We don’t have any monetization mechanism in place within out design. So there might not be any monetary incentive for counselors to join the app who aren’t purely motivated by altruistic reasons.</p>
                                        <p>Our design is chiefly aimed at students when it comes to the users/patients component. While other users who are not students can easily sign-up and start using CounseLink, they might be faced a user experience not catered to them. This limitation is especially apparent on the list of issues available on the issue selection screen (topics like domestic abuse, marriage problems, etc aren’t included in our design). So the trade-off over here is that we are foregoing a broader user base for a more student-focused user experience.</p>
                                        <p>We haven’t included accessibility considerations into the design, therefore the application might be difficult to use for people with visual, hearing and physical impairments.</p>
