                                        <p>This project has three phases. We started with the background research, and then we tried to define the problems by walking through the current system and getting initial feedback from the user panel. </p>
                                        <p>Then, I had three rounds of design iteration to evolve from wireframe to high-fidelity prototype. In between each round, I would present my design to the product manager, the design team, the development team, and the user panel to get helpful feedback. </p>
                                        <p>At present, we are in the third phase of developing the system, and I am supporting the development team to finalize screens for MVP.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">What is KMA? </h3>
                                        <p>KMA is short for Key Measures Analyzer. It is a powerful internal tool for analysts to understand the potential success of a product through comparisons. The analysts compose competitive sets of the study data and then run comparisons to get the prediction results.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/kma/kmaflow.png" width="60%" ></div><br>
                                        <p>Why do we need comparisons in KMA? Because we can't tell if the raw data is good or bad without context.</p> 
                                        <p>For example, if a company wants to launch a new drink. They might do the marketing research get a potential customer satisfaction rate of 80%. But what does 80% indicate? We can't tell without comparing this with other data. If we could know the average satisfaction rate of all drinks is about 70%, then we can infer that product is likely to have success in the market. Of course, comparisons in KMA are much more complicated than this, but this can reflect how KMA works. </p>
                                        <br><br>

                                        <p>Before trying to figure out the problems of the current KMA, we tried to define the main user groups and then understand their goals and pain points while using the current system.</p>

                                        <p>After that, we walked through the KMA pages to have a usability evaluation of the system. We also had an initial feedback session with affinity diagramming with the user panel to get insights from users. Finally, we summarized the major user frustrations of current KMA as below: </p>

                                        <p>Finally, we defined the key design challenge of this project as:</p><br>

                                        <p><strong>1. Consistency with Nielsen design system</strong></p>
                                        <p>One significant achievement of this project is that we successfully integrated the old KMA system into the new Nielsen application platform called "Nielsen Studio." To keep the design consistent with the current platform, I studied and then applied the components and patterns while designing.  </p>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>2. Increased user satisfaction &amp; Foreseeable improvement in efficiency, learnability, and visibility</strong></p>
                                        <p>According to the survey results that we have collected among 27 users who have seen our final designs, we were surprised to find out that the overall satisfaction score rose from 2.4 to 4.7, which means an approximately 95.8% improvement in terms of user satisfaction. </p>
                                        <p>Also, from the word cloud of their answers to the question of how they feel about the new design, we can see most users think that the new design is intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient. </p>
                                        <p>In addition, based on our conversation with the managers, they think the visibility of the projects has improved a lot. They could monitor the progress of projects from the homepage without going deeper into the system.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/kma/feedback.png" width="85%" ></div><br><br>
                                        <p><strong>3. Contribution to the design system</strong></p>
                                        <p>In addition to keeping consistent with the current design system, I contributed some design patterns that could be helpful for other projects to our style guide. One example of these is the duplication naming convention.</p>
                                        <p>In KMA, it is a common practice to make duplicates. But the old duplication naming convention is to add a "Copy of" to the name. So if an analyst duplicates a workbook 3 times, the name would be "Copy of Copy of Copy of workbook name." Considering the limited horizontal space and the complicated operations, it will confuse the users. Based on that, I came up with an alternative solution to make the duplication name much clearer:</p>

                                        <br>
                                    </div>

                                        <p><strong>1. Design with Constraints</strong></p>
                                        <p>The first challenge for me was to design with many constraints like time and resources budget from the product manager, the current design system of Nielsen, and the technical complexities from the developments. To balance these constraints, I tried to involve all stakeholders (PM, design team, dev team, and users) in the iteration process and revisit the design after listening to all their opinions. However, despite different voices from all stakeholders, it's my responsibility to determine the priority of all these factors and make the final design decision.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. Thinking Out of the Box</strong></p>
                                        <p>Another interesting finding from this project is that the more I learned about the current system, the more I am getting used to its information architecture and wireframe. It was hard for me to have a completely new idea at first. To solve this problem, I tried to think from a new perspective. I started to think about what users want the most from KMA, and then went through all the necessary steps users had to do to get this result. This helped me to rethink the end-to-end flow of the whole system and see opportunities to improve. </p>
