                                        <p>I worked as a UX design intern in the operation platform team of Taobao New Retail Design Department during the summer of 2018. My job was to collaborate with product managers and software engineers to design the wireframe and interface of a back-end management system. I was also responsible for conducting usability evaluations of the current system to help improve the user experience. My design helped the whole system to improve its operational efficiency.</p>
                                        <p>Below is the workflow of my internship. Because this project is under an NDA agreement, I am not able to show the details of the interface or the information architecture. However, I would like to share the general insights and reflections I have got during my internship.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Characteristics of back-end systems</h3><br>
                                        <p>The first challenge for me at my internship was to work on the back-end system. This is different from the consumer-facing App design or web design projects I have done before. After my learning and working process at internship, I gained more understanding about the unique characteristics of back-end systems. </p>
                                        <p><strong>Complicated and Professional</strong></p>
                                        <p>Most back-end systems are for advanced operations like monitoring or configuration. The web pages are usually much more complicated than consumer-facing websites. They may have more forms, figures, and other advanced operation elements. Although most users of the back-end management web pages are professionals, the complexity makes the learning path tough</p>
                                        <p><strong>Large User Group</strong></p>
                                        <p> Some back-end systems have a large user group. For example, product managers, developers, operational staff, and designers are all target users of the sales campaign management system that I have worked on. New users would usually require less learning burden, while expert users want more efficient operations and advanced features. We have to take all of their requirements into consideration during design.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Efficiency Matters</strong></p>
                                        <p>Different from the goal of retaining users for a longer time of most B2C or C2C websites, the purpose of the back-end web pages is mainly to help users operate more efficiently. Users may need to interact with the web pages hundreds or even thousands of times one day. As a consequence, an improvement of 0.01s could mean a lot for the company.</p>
                                        <br><br>
                                    </div>
                                     
                                      
                                        <div class="single-project-description">
                                        <h3 class="owner-text">How to Improve Efficiency?</h3><br>
                                        <p><strong>Error Prevention</strong></p>
                                        <p>Efficiency does not always mean fast. Once a faulty operation happens, it might take more time to recover, or it might even cause catastrophic results. When I designed the setting pages, I added double check notification for every submission action. Although users have to spend a few seconds to check the setting items they have modified, this prevents the wrong operation that would affect thousands of pages.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/intern/confirm.jpeg" width="35%" ></div><br><br>
                                        <p><strong>Lower Cognitive Load, Visual Load, and Motor Load</strong></p>
                                        <p>In human factors study, researchers suggest that there are basically three different kinds of demands or loads that you can make on a person:
                                        cognitive (including memory), visual, and motor. Each load uses up a different amount of mental resources. The order of the loads from most “expensive” to least is cognitive, visual, and motor.</p>
                                         <div class="pimages"><img src="img/intern/load1.jpg" width="100%" ></div><br>
                                         <p>For example, while redesigning a configuration page like above, I regrouped all the setting items into three large groups to make each focus area smaller to reduce the visual load. And I rearranged all the groups and the setting items within each group based on their frequency of use. This will make the action path shorter and reduce the motor load. Each group can also be folded. So users can find the setting option quickly, and different users can focus only on the part they are working on. In this way, the cognitive load could be largely reduced.</p>

                                    </div>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Reflections</h3><br>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>Work in an Agile team</strong></p>
                                        <p>Internet companies usually apply the Agile development method which is really different from what we did at school. As a UX designer, I need to apply Lean UX skills to create wireframes or prototypes rapidly to gain feedback at the early phase. Then we would go through several rounds of iteration to help improve the product.</p>
                                    
                                        <p><strong>How to work with other roles</strong></p>
                                        <p>I worked closely with the product manager and front-end developers in this project. The product manager would usually show me a PRD (Product Requirement Document) and tell me those are features of our product. However, as a UX designer, I should not just turn those features into wireframes or interfaces. I should think about user demands behind the PRD to make sure users' real needs are considered.</p>
                                        <p>For example, I was told to add "Save" and "Reset" buttons for each setting item like the below image by the product manager. However, this would largely increase the visual and motor burden and eventually influence the efficiency of operation. I realized the user demand behind it is to prevent errors in operation. As a result, I put only two buttons at the bottom and added a "double check" box to help users check their operations before submission. In this way, we could both cater to user demands and improve efficiency.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/intern/buttons.jpg" width="70%" ></div><br>
                                        <p>On the other hand, front-end developers might often tell me that we don't need to modify a detail on the UI because that would cost more time and it will not influence users on completing the task. In this circumstance, I would show data to persuade them that the modification is beneficial in the long run. For example, if we spend 2 hours to make the form elements perfectly aligned, it might save 1 second for each user. Suppose we have 200 users who usually operate the form 10 times a day, we could save more than 4 hours in just one week. </p>
                                        
                                        <br><br>
                                    </div> 

                                    <div class="single-project-description">
                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Summary</h3><br>
                                        <p>To conclude, this internship experience not only helps me to learn more design skills and knowledge but also helps me to understand how UX designers work in an Agile team and how should UX designers work with other people in a group. I believe that the knowledge and skills I have gained have helped me to become a better UX designer on my career path. </p>
