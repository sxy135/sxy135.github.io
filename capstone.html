                                        <p>This is my capstone project with the <a href="https://www.state.gov/m/drr/">Diplomatic Reception Rooms(DRR) of the U.S. Department of State</a>.</p>

                                        <p> As is shown in the image below, the Diplomatic Reception Rooms(DRR) have a large number of historical artifacts. However, this collection is not widely available to view or use by teachers, students, and the public for some reason currently. Therefore, DRR wants to find an alternative way to make the best use of their resources to support teaching and learning in the arts and humanities in K-12, primarily 4-12, education across the United States. </p>

                                        <p>I worked as the UX researcher and UX designer in this project. My job was to help DRR discover what teachers and students need and to come up with product concepts which could provide teachers and students with engaging, easy-to-navigate, highly interactive teaching and learning experiences. In this project, we followed the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/contextual-design">Contextual Design</a> methods by Karen Holtzblatt, and Karen was also an advisor for our capstone project.  </p>

                                        <p> There are two major phases in this project. In Phase One (2018 Fall), we mainly conducted user research by interview and contextual inquiry. Then we used contextual design models and affinity diagramming to analyze the user data we have collected to inform the product concept design. At the end of Phase One, we delivered a report of insights on teaching and learning experience with online tools and three product concepts to the client.</p>

                                        <p>In Phase Two (2019 Spring), we went deeper with one out of the three product concepts. Finally, we created the high-fidelity interactive prototype through three rounds of the design iteration process. <a href="#finaldesign">(Click here to check the final design) </a></p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">User Research</h3><br>
                                        <p> We recruited 22 participants in our user research process. They are K4-K12 teachers from different grade levels and different subjects.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/drr/demographics.jpg" width="100%" ></div>
                                        <p>For each participant, we did a 2-hour user research session which includes a semi-structured interview about their preferences of online tools and a contextual inquiry to observe how teachers interact with online tools. For online tools, we mainly focused on the three most popular types of online resources - interactive timeline, virtual tours, and online exhibits.</p>
                                        <p>
                                       After each user research session, we would have an interpretation session to transform the interview notes into formal affinity notes. Besides, we also created three experience models (identity model, collaboration model, artifact model) to help us collect and analyze helpful information such as teachers' personalities, the relationship between different stakeholders, and teachers' interaction patterns with UI elements of online tools.</p>
                                        <p>Below are some examples of the experience models we created in the interpretation session.</p><br>

                                        <p>After all the interviews, we consolidated all experience models (identity model, collaboration model, artifact model) that we made for each participant into three final models based on the contextual design method.</p>
                                        <p>1. Identity Model</p>
                                        <p>It shows different observations of sources of pride, self-esteem, and value of individuals, and also represents different aspects of self that matter for the project focus. <a href="drr_identitymodel.pdf">(Click here to view more details)</a></p>

                                        <p>2. Collaboration Model</p>
                                        <p>It describes how users collaborate to complete the observed activities and it reminds designers to keep user connections in mind while designing.<a href="drr_collaborationmodel.pdf"> (Click here to view more details)</a></p>

                                        <p>3. Artifact Model</p>
                                        <p>We create three artifact models for the three types of online resources we focused on - interactive timeline, virtual tour, and online exhibit. It captures which elements of the website people interacted with and how was their experience using those elements. <a href="drr_artifactmodel.pdf"> (Click here to view more details)</a></p><br>

                                        <p>For the affinity diagramming process, we printed all the affinity notes on the yellow sticky notes and started to group them. </p>
                                        <p>After the first round of grouping, we followed the contextual design methods to create blue labels for each group. Then, we regrouped the blue labels and created pink labels for groups of blue labels. Finally, we create the top-level green labels for the pink label groups. Below are the photos and some examples of our notes.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/drr/notes.jpg" width="100%" ></div><br>
                                        <p>We summarized seven top-level green labels as below which represents the overarching themes of our data. Those findings could implicate the teachers' styles of teaching and their preferences/expectations for online resources. These findings could guide us in the following design and visioning process.</p>

                                    <p>Then, we did a wall-walk to generate design ideas based on the affinity notes. After we got all the design ideas from team members, we discussed those design ideas and then selected the "top hot ideas" from all the ideas. After grouping all the ideas, we picked three of them for visioning :</p>
                                    <p>1. A guided virtual tour that incorporates timeline and exhibits based on context</p>
                                    <p>2. Activity finder and generator for teachers </p>
                                    <p>3. Immersive games for students to enable learning</p>
                                    <p>As is shown in the images below, in the visioning process, we discussed the features and the user journeys of the product concept.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Initial Product Concepts</h3><br>
                                        <p>After the visioning, three of our team members developed the prototype for the initial product concept demonstration.</p>
                                        <p>I was in charge of the product concept design for the guided virtual tour concept. The guided virtual tour has a virtual tour guide who can walk you through the tour of a customized theme.  </p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/drr/tour2.jpeg" width="75%" ></div><br>
                                        <p>We also had two other product concept prototypes for the immersive game and activity generator platform ideas as shown in the image.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/drr/products.jpg" width="90%" ></div>
                                        <br>
										<p>Finally, DRR chose the "Activity Generator" for us to research deeper. They made this decision based on a survey among teachers as well as the skill set of the engineer teams they work with.  </p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Storyboarding + UED + User Flow</h3><br>
                                        <p>In the spring semester, we started with storyboarding to help us build connections with the user scenario, personas, and various research findings. Next, we worked on the UED (User Environment Design) to establish the basic product structure and functions. After building the initial information architecture, we created several typical user flows to map out the interactions across the platform.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Prototyping + User Testing</h3><br>
                                        <p>We finished three rounds of prototyping and user testing to help us iterate. After each round of iteration, the list of noted issues was revisited and used as a reference to improve the design. </p>
                                        <p>Besides that, we also had one expert critique session for each round of iteration. During the session, we would present to some experienced designers from the industry and they would provide us with professional feedback. </p>
                                        <p><strong>1. Paper Prototype </strong></p>
                                        <p>The first round of user testing was done with a preliminary paper mockup, with four educators. This round of testing was to help the team understand why certain design elements succeeded or failed, identify needed functions, and to test if the prototype stood up to use. The interviewer and user worked together to uncover problems and come up with alternative designs.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. Low-fidelity Prototype </strong></p>
                                        <p> A low-fidelity wireframe prototype was created based on the feedback received. Functions were added where needed, layouts were adjusted, and the prototype moved from physical to digital.  Four additional interviews were conducted, with the aim of validating the adjustments from the previous prototype, as well as to test layouts, interaction design, and content presentation. </p>
                                        <p><strong>3. High-fidelity Prototype </strong></p>
                                        <p>Findings from the wireframe interviews were reviewed and incorporated into a high fidelity version of the Activity Canvas, complete with DRR content and a visual design style derived from user feedback. This iteration was tested with eight more educators to verify that previously noted issues had been accounted for and to finalize the design.</p>

                                        <p> Below are some of the main screens of our final design. The "Activity Canvas" is a platform for teachers to explore objects and pre-made activities based on the artifacts in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms. Teachers can search, save, and customize objects and pre-made activities on Activity Canvas to help provide an engaging teaching and learning experience to students. </p>
                                        <p>The Activity Canvas solves teacher's problem of finding resources or classroom activities for their different teaching goals or themes by providing them with an easy-to-search resource platform with a large number of high-quality pre-made teaching materials tailored to the conventional teaching standards. It also provides teachers with options to easily save, share, and customize teaching materials. In terms of design, we tried to make it simple, visually appealing, and easy-to-navigate to help teachers have a pleasant experience while interacting with the product. </p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Open Issues</h3><br>
                                        <p> Through the process leading to the final designs presented above, our team compiled a list of open issues to be further considered during the development of Activity Canvas and accompanying activities. The main issues are listed below.  </p>
                                        <p>1.	Per the design team’s formative user research, listing corresponding state educational standards would provide major benefits to teachers. However, state standards differ and some schools aren’t teaching to standards at all. The design should allow for teachers to see the standards most relevant to their work.</p>
                                        <p>2.	Switching between Lexile levels with object descriptions would provide major benefits to teachers. Providing multiple options can be quite helpful.</p>
                                        <p>3.	Increasing collaboration in Activity Canvas will improve the teachers’ experience and may make Activity Canvas an online ‘place’ teachers will return to.</p>
                                        <p>4.	Increase customizability in Activity Canvas. Allowing teachers to create their own activities and upload them would provide opportunities for teachers to feel more ownership and engagement with Activity Canvas.</p>
                                        <p>5.	Allow teachers to upload their own media and link resources from other organizations into their collections and in customized activities.</p>
                                        <p>6.	Create a student-facing experience to allow students to create and submit work.</p>
                                        <p>7.	There’s power in customizability, but how do we make it easy to jump in right away? There need to be immediate engagement points.</p>
