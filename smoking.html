                                        <p>This is a team project for the Health Informatics class at the University of Maryland. In this project, we proposed the design solution of a smoking cessation app called "Quitogether."  This App integrates the social support element by connecting people at the "action stage" to help one another quit smoking.</p>
                                        <p>Below is a video to show how Quitogether might help people to quit smoking in real-life scenarios.</p>

                                        <p> To understand the background knowledge of smoking behaviors and the existing solutions of smoking cessation, our team used primary literatures as our sources of understanding this subject matter. We found four significant insights from these sources and used them as the guidelines for our design.</p>

                                        <p>According to all we have learned in the background study, we defined our target user group as young adults (18-35 years old) who are at the action stage of quitting smoking. Also, based on previous study findings, we decided to add social support, data tracking, and reflection features to the future product to help people quit more effectively.</p>
                                        <p>Therefore, our design challenge is -- </p>
                                        <p><strong>How to help young smokers in the action phase to quit smoking in an effective and creative way by providing social support, data tracking, and self-reflection features? </strong></p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Diary Study</h3><br>
                                        <p>Our team designed a diary study research to learn more about the context of their smoking behavior. This study also served the purpose of understanding the effectiveness of self-reflection on the participant’s perception of their behavior.</p>
                                        <p>Participants were asked to track when and where they smoked, how many cigarettes they smoked, and why they smoked. At the end of the seven-day study, we interviewed each participant to learn in-depth motivations for smoking behaviors, smoking behavior patterns, and how the seven-day diary study influenced their smoking behaviors.</p>
                                        <p>Below is an example of our diary study notes and the major findings in the diary study.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Paper Prototyping + User Testing</h3><br>
                                        <p>Based on the findings from the user research and diary study, we came up with the initial design. The product is called Quitogether. It will help people reflect on their smoking behavior by tracking and visualizing data regarding smoking and smoking urges. People will offer and receive social support from group members and from other people who are using Quitogether. We also created a low fidelity paper prototype for user testing.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/smoking/testing.png" width="100%" ></div>
                                        <p>We conducted user testing with three participants who were current smokers with more than a 12-month smoking experience. After the user testing, we discovered some interesting findings that inspired our final design:  </p>
                                        <p><strong>- Finding 1: Never mention "smoking" in the help request message </strong></p>
                                        <p>Although it is helpful to get peer support, our participants said that keeping showing words about "smoking" in front of group members might increase their urge to smoke. As a consequence, in our final design, we used a metaphor to achieve this "secret handshake."</p>
                                        <p>In the final design, we describe the urge to smoke as a "monster." So whenever a monster is attacking the user, he or she can send out a help message to other group members to ask their help to defeat the "monster." In this way, we can help users to overcome the urge in a playful way without influencing other teammates. We also want to provide users with more options to customize this help message.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/smoking/monster.png" width="100%" ></div><br/>
                                        <p><strong>- Finding 2: Track and show smoking urges instead of the number of cigarettes they have smoked</strong></p>
                                        <p>According to the feedback, although it is a common practice in current products, tracking the number of cigarettes they have smoked every day is not really helpful since it has already happened, and tracking can not stop it. And seeing the number of cigarettes will always make them feel bad about themselves.</p>
                                        <p> So we decided to ask users to track their smoking urges. This would help users smoke less more effectively, as it can help them overcome some of the urges at the moment. Also, we could highlight how many times users overcame the urge of smoking to offer them a sense of achievement.</p>
                                        <p>As is shown in the image below, the grey bar represents the urge of smoking, while the purple bar represents the cigarettes they have actually smoked. We could highlight their achievements in overcoming smoking urges in the daily summary to motivate users to stick to the plan.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/smoking/urge.png" width="100%" ></div><br/>
                                        <p><strong>- Finding 3: Successful cessation experience and knowledge sharing is necessary</strong></p>
                                        <p>Although a small cessation group is beneficial, our participants think that they still need a broader community to communicate and share their experiences. Besides, they believe stories with real tracking data are especially convincing. So we decided to add an online community with data sharing features for them to share their quitting plans/tracking results and get help from a larger group.</p>

                                        <p>In order to design an effective health-tracking app, all aspects of the design must be corroborated by clinical studies and primary literature. We utilized this strategy to translate the insights that we gained from such theoretical knowledge into functional features of a potential new product in the healthcare domain.</p>
                                        <p>In the future, our design can be further improved by the following: <br/>
                                        - Allow users to customize existing features such as the help message<br/>
                                        - Provide advanced ways of data visualization to help users dive deep into their data<br/>
                                        - Offer users action-based incentives like reward badges to award positive reinforcement <br/>
