                                        <p>This is a team project for our Health Informatics class. In this project, we proposed a design of a smoke
cessation app, which integrates the social support element by connecting people at the “action stage”
of the stage-based model to help one another quit smoking.</p>
<p>Welcome to watch the following video to gain a quick understanding of our design.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Background Study</h3><br>
                                        <p> To understand the background and existed solutions of smoking cessation, our team went through
papers, articles, and social platforms to dive deeper into the subject matter. We found four major insights
from these sources and use them as the guidelines for our design.</p>
<!--
                                        <p><strong>1. Lack of social interaction in existing smoking cessation apps</strong></p>
                                        <p>Common features that existing smoking cessation apps employ are tracking benefits (e.g., money
saved and health benefits accrued), tracking the number of quitting days, hypnosis techniques, goal
setting, education, measuring lung health, and games for quitting.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. People need social support from others to remain motivated</strong></p>
                                        <p>Currently,
when before, during, or after quitting, people use social network websites such as Facebook and Twitter, and other online communities to look for information, seek help, post achievement, and
share experience. Furthermore, studies show that people are more comfortable to share experience
related to health and behavior change, and respond to other people in a supportive manner when
they are on anonymous online communities.</p>
                                        <p><strong>3. Targeting the people who are already in action</strong></p>
                                        <p>Previous research identified five stages of change of quitting smoking, which are: precontemplation,
contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Research shows that people at different
stages have different preferences for information exchange. People at the action stage are the
most active—they seek information and plans, share achievement and stories, and ask and answer
questions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>4. Improve mindfulness to achieve behavior change</strong></p>
                                        <p>Tracking and reflecting on smoking behavior can promote the mindfulness and effectively help
smokers quit. Previous research enriches our understanding of addictive behaviors and the nature of
behavior change. When the urge of smoking appears, smokers unconsciously ignore all the
negative aspects of smoking and repeat the habit of smoking.</p>-->

                                        <p>According to all we have learned in the background study, we defined our target user group as young adults (18-35
years old) who are at the action stage of quitting
smoking. Also, according to previous studies, we decided to add social support, data tracking, and reflection features to the future product to help people quit more effectively.</p>
                                        <p>Therefore, our design challenge is -- </p>
                                        <p><strong>How to find a way to provide young smokers who are in the action phase with social support and to improve their mindfulness to help them quit smoking?</strong></p>
                                        <br><br>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="single-project-description">
                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Diary Study</h3><br>
                                        <p>Our team designed a diary study research to learn more about the context of their smoking behavior. This study also served the purpose of understanding the effectiveness of self-reflection and mindfulness on the participant’s perception of their behavior.</p>
                                        <p>We did a seven-day diary study with young smokers. Five participants were recruited, and three completed the study. Participants were asked to track when and where they smoked, how many cigarettes they smoked and why they smoked. At the end of the seven-day study, we interviewed each participant to learn in-depth reasons for smoking behaviors, smoking behavior patterns, and how the seven-day diary study influences their smoking behaviors.</p>
                                        <p>Below is a sample of our diary study notes and the major findings in the diary study.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">Paper Prototyping + User Testing</h3><br>
                                        <p>Based on the findings from the user research and diary study, we came up with the initial design. The product is called Quitogether. It will help people reflect on their smoking behavior by tracking and visualizing data regarding smoking and smoking urges. People will give and receive social support from group members who work closely to quit smoking and from other people who are using Quitogether. We also created a low fidelity paper prototype for user testing.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/smoking/testing.png" width="100%" ></div>
                                        <p>We conducted user testing with three participants who were current smokers with more than 12-month smoking experience. After the testing, we gathered some useful feedback that later has been applied to our final design such as  </p>
                                        <p><strong>- Don't mention "smoking" in the help request message </strong></p>
                                        <p>Although it is helpful to get peer support, our participants mentioned that keeping showing words about "smoking" in front of group members might remind them of the urge to smoke. As a consequence, in our final design, we used a metaphor to achieve this "secret handshake."</p>
                                        <p>In the final design, we describe the urge to smoking as a "monster." So whenever a monster is attacking the user, he or she can send out a help message to the teammates to ask their help to defeat the "monster." In this way, we can help users to overcome the urge in a playful way without influencing other teammates. We also want to provide users with more options to customize this help message.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/smoking/monster.png" width="100%" ></div><br/>
                                        <p><strong>- Track and show urges to promote mindfulness and positive reinforcement</strong></p>
                                        <p>According to the feedback, although it is a common practice in current products, tracking the number of cigarettes they have smoked every day is not really helpful since they have already smoked. And seeing the number of cigarettes will only make them feel bad about themselves.</p>
                                        <p> So we decided to ask users to track their smoking urges. This would help users quit smoking more effectively, as it can help them overcome some of the urges at the moment. Also, we could highlight how many times users overcame the urge of smoking to offer them a sense of achievement and help them stick to their quitting plan.</p>
                                        <p>As is shown in the below image, the grey bar represents the urge of smoking, while the purple bar represents the cigarettes they have actually smoked. We could highlight their achievements of overcoming smoking urges in the daily summary to motivate users to stick to the plan.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/smoking/urge.png" width="100%" ></div><br/>
                                        <p><strong>- Cessation experience and knowledge Sharing</strong></p>
                                        <p>Although a small cessation group is beneficial, our participants think that they still need a broader community to communicate and share their experiences. Besides, they believe stories with real tracking data is especially convincing. So we decided to add an online community with data sharing feature for them to share their quitting plans/tracking results and get help from a larger group.</p>

                                        <p>When we design products in the personal health area, all design solutions should be based on professional research results to ensure their effectiveness. In this project, we spent a huge amount of time reading papers and articles about smoking cessation. Those findings in our background study part served as the "North Star" in our following design process. Moreover, those previous research findings also provided us with a solid theoretical basis for our design. </p>
                                        <p>In the future, we could improve our product in the following way: <br/>
