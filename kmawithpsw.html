                                        <p>This project has three phases. We started with the background research, and then we tried to define the problems by walking through the current system and getting initial feedback from the user panel. </p>
                                        <p>Then, I had three rounds of design iteration to evolve from wireframe to high-fidelity prototype. In between each round, I would present my design to the product manager, the design team, the development team, and the user panel to get helpful feedback. </p>
                                        <p>At present, we are in the third phase of developing the system, and I am supporting the development team to finalize screens for MVP.</p>

                                        <h3 class="owner-text">What is KMA? </h3>
                                        <p>KMA is short for Key Measures Analyzer. It is a powerful internal tool for analysts to understand the potential success of a product through comparisons. The analysts compose competitive sets of the study data and then run comparisons to get the prediction results.</p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/kma/kmaflow.png" width="60%" ></div><br>
                                        <p>Why do we need comparisons in KMA? Because we can't tell if the raw data is good or bad without context.</p> 
                                        <p>For example, if a company wants to launch a new drink. They might do the marketing research get a potential customer satisfaction rate of 80%. But what does 80% indicate? We can't tell without comparing this with other data. If we could know the average satisfaction rate of all drinks is about 70%, then we can infer that product is likely to have success in the market. Of course, comparisons in KMA are much more complicated than this, but this can reflect how KMA works. </p>

                                        <p>Before trying to figure out the problems of the current KMA, we tried to define the main user groups and then understand their goals and pain points while using the current system.</p>

                                        <p>After that, we walked through the KMA pages to have a usability evaluation of the system. We also had an initial feedback session with affinity diagramming with the user panel to get insights from users. Finally, we summarized the major user frustrations of current KMA as below: </p>
                                        <div class="pimages"><img src="img/kma/problems2.png" width="52%" ></div><br>-->

                                        <p>Finally, I defined the key design challenge of this project as:</p><br>

                                        <p>I had three rounds of iteration to help me make my design better. In each round, I would present my design to the design team to get critiques about the design details to make sure my design is consistent with the current design system as well as to collect some different design ideas. I would also present the design to a user panel to verify my design and to get more insights from users. </p>

                                        <p>Now it's time to revisit the four design challenges that I have defined - <strong>Efficiency, Learnability, Visibility, and Consistency</strong>. These could also be used as the metrics to measure the success in this project.</p>
                                        <p>In order to understand the impacts of this redesign project, I have tried to set up some user feedback or user testing sessions with the product manager as well as send out surveys to collect relevant qualitative and quantitive data to measure the user feedback. In the meantime, I also presented the design to the product design team to get internal feedback. Based on the data I have gathered, the project has made a success in the following aspects:  </p>
                                        <p>1. <strong>95.8%</strong> improvement in <strong>user satisfaction</strong> (based on the survey)</p>
                                        <p>2. Minimum of <strong>15% time saving</strong> with the MVP  (based on the survey and user testing)</p>
                                        <p>3. Improvement in <strong>learnability</strong> and <strong>visibility</strong>  (based on the survey and user feedback session)</p>
                                        <p>4. <strong>Consistency</strong>with the design system (based on feedback from the product design team) </p>
                                        <p>Below is an example of the user satisfaction grading and the word cloud based the survey data. </p>

                                        <p><strong>1. Consistency with Nielsen design system</strong></p>
                                        <p>One significant achievement of this project is that we successfully integrated the old KMA system into the new Nielsen application platform called "Nielsen Studio." To keep the design consistent with the current platform, I studied and then applied the components and patterns while designing.  </p>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>2. Increased user satisfaction &amp; Foreseeable improvement in efficiency, learnability, and visibility</strong></p>
                                        <p>According to the survey results that we have collected among 27 users who have seen our final designs, we were surprised to find out that the overall satisfaction score rose from 2.4 to 4.7, which means an approximately 95.8% improvement in terms of user satisfaction. </p>
                                        <p>Also, from the word cloud of their answers to the question of how they feel about the new design, we can see most users think that the new design is intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient. </p>
                                        <p>In addition, based on our conversation with the managers, they think the visibility of the projects has improved a lot. They could monitor the progress of projects from the homepage without going deeper into the system.</p>

                                        <p><strong>3. Contribution to the design system</strong></p>
                                        <p>In addition to keeping consistent with the current design system, I contributed some design patterns that could be helpful for other projects to our style guide. One example of these is the duplication naming convention.</p>
                                        <p>In KMA, it is a common practice to make duplicates. But the old duplication naming convention is to add a "Copy of" to the name. So if an analyst duplicates a workbook 3 times, the name would be "Copy of Copy of Copy of workbook name." Considering the limited horizontal space and the complicated operations, it will confuse the users. Based on that, I came up with an alternative solution to make the duplication name much clearer:</p>

                                        <p><strong>1. Design with Constraints</strong></p>
                                        <p>There are many constraints like time and resources budget from the product manager, the current design system, and the technical complexities from the developments in design projects. To balance these, I tried to involve all stakeholders in an earlier phase of the design process and this helped to keep the design on the right track. However, despite different voices from all stakeholders, it's my responsibility to determine the priority of all these factors and make the final design decision.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. Thinking Out of the Box</strong></p>
                                        <p>At the beginning of the redesign process, I thought I could just improve the interaction and visual design based on the current structure. However, as I learned more about the pain points, I realized that I have to think out of the box and redesign the whole information architecture to create a better and more intuitive user flow. </p>
                                        <p><strong>3. Systematic Thinking</strong></p>
                                        <p>The requirement of keeping consistent with the current design system and the work of defining components and patterns in the design system helps me realize the importance of systematic thinking. As a designer, I should not care about just one application, I should always design for the whole set of products.</p>
